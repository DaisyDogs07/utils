## Utils
These are utils that anyone can use.

If you want to add something just make a pull request and I'll add it. 
I'll also fix any mistakes you might have made (If I see any)

All utils must follow these 2 rules:
* Must be written in pure JavaScript (For browser support)
* No other files are added (This rule will be here until I find a way for this to be possible for browsers)
